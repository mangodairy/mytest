Each installation methods have a graphical and text mode.

### Installing the OS with bootable media ( CD or DVD).

**Note:**  Considering you are using a brand new machine or there is no data in your existing system. If this is not the case take the backup of the data before starting the installation. There are options to install Linux by keeping the data untouched however, it is difficult to understand a person who is very new to Linux.
