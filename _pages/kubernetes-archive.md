## Kubernetes

This is Kubernetes introductory series, we will cover the basic concept of Kubernetes in 7 days( Seven modules so if you do not have time in your day to day work spent 10 minutes going through it so that you will get a basic understanding of Kubernetes in a week time.  The Kubernetes is well documented in [kubernetes.io web site ](https://kubernetes.io/) but it is a little difficult for a beginner to get through that documentation. Initially, I found it difficult to understand the Kubernetes concept and it was a little difficult to walk through the documentation. I tried my level best to simplify the concept.
