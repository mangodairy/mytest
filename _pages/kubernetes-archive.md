1. [ Kubernetes in 7 days? In a week !!](https://rajith.in/Kubernetes/#kubernetes-in-7-days-in-a-week-) This is the introductory series of Kubernetes. Here we have 7 modules along with the demo. In this, we are going through the Kubernetes architecture, pods, deployment, service, volumes, along with the details of corresponding definition files.  
2. [Walking through the pods. ](https://rajith.in/Kubernetes/#walking-through-the-pods--%EF%B8%8F) Here we are going through the details of pods. Verifying details of the pod, analyzing the pod, connecting to the running containers and many more.
3. [Play with Deployments](Coming soon!) Coming soon!
4. [ Journey towards CKAD.](Coming soon!) Coming soon!
## Kubernetes in 7 days? In a week !!!

Kubernetes in 7 days( Seven modules, **if you do not have time in your day to day work, spent 10 minutes going through this,** so that you will get a basic understanding of Kubernetes in a week time ). The Kubernetes is well documented in [kubernetes.io web site ](https://kubernetes.io/) but it is little difficult for beginners to get through that documentation. I tried my level best to simplify the concept.

So what are you waiting for? 10 minutes in a day is just the time you normally take for going through some post in your favourite whatsup group.

I found time to prepare all this documentation by avoiding chat in a few of my favourite whatsup group. So no doubt you can make it too!
